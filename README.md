## What is this about?
 This is a repository of all my exercises, labs, and other activities in **CSDC105** *Trends in Application Development*
   
## What software/application is very much needed in the world today?
   I think the software/application needed in the world today is an application that can help students submit their work which their teacher/s can access. They can submit their work with "free data" if that's possible since not everyone has access to the internet especially during a pandemic. With all these online classes happening around the world, this can actually help tons of students finish their studies.
